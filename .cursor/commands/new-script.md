# new-script

Notes for adding a new Raycast custom script
- Look at the other files in the folder for refence
- No need to chmod it
- You can write it in Python or Bash, whichever is easier/makes more sense for this particular custom script
- You can use utils from @utils.py / @utils.sh  and/or make new ones (if the function is likely to be used in other scripts)
- Keep it really simple!!!

The particulars of the script you are being asked to write will be provided by the user.
